As an architect, Michelangelo re-designed the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Whether sculpting, painting, or drawing, he instilled a sense of awe-inspiring wonder or terribilità in his works, capturing the emotional and spiritual intensity in the twisting, muscular bodies of his subjects. Michelangelo himself said, 'I saw the angel and carved until I set him free.'",

    "description": "There was a problematic in my mind that puzzled me until the near future and caused me to experience stagnation in my painting process for a certain period.What and how do I want to tell/ reflect with my education and what I have learned, in short, with my ability? Going to Berlin for Erasmus in 2023, made the problematic in my mind change the direction of my approach to the canvas. During my time painting in Berlin, cultural and artistic approach differences outside of what I was used to helped my perspective evolve. It created an environment where the imprisonment created by the questions in my mind was broken and such unknowns turned into a repulsive effect. In this process, I started to think on the canvas with my brush, without being afraid of the white of it.I am focusing on associating different surface perspectives, elements of different time/space, various light sources on the surface of the canvas and creating a time break/integrity of my own.For my context and my subject; I consider it as a reflection of my process from the period when I started the canvas to the moment of my last brush stroke. I determine my starting points from the scenes, colors, emotions, people and conversations that I am influenced by in my daily life.I am trying to reduce the impact of the pre-draft period on my finished work by keeping my sketching processes as short as I can. In this way, I am aiming to add a different value to my painting process with a more organic, experimental way.",
