    "description": "A founder of the High Italian Renaissance style, Michelangelo (di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni) created some of the most influential works in the history of Western art: the marble statues of David (1504) and The Pietà (ca. 1498-1499), as well as the Sistine Chapel frescos in the Vatican, Rome, depicting Genesis (such as in The Creation of Adam (1510)) and the Last Judgment. As an architect, Michelangelo re-designed the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Whether sculpting, painting, or drawing, he instilled a sense of awe-inspiring wonder or terribilità in his works, capturing the emotional and spiritual intensity in the twisting, muscular bodies of his subjects. Michelangelo himself said, 'I saw the angel and carved until I set him free.'",
